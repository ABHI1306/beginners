# General way of writing python program
## For writing a piece of code in Python
Open a text editor (preferably use [atom](https://atom.io) or [sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) or [VS_Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org))

You can always use python interpreter or Python shell that can be directly used in python IDLE or in Terminal
It is recommended just to use for checking one or two lines of code or in case you want to view the working of loop and want to get help

### python IDLE opens like this:
> ```
> Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jun 26 2018, 23:26:24) 
> [Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
> Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
> >>> print("Hello World")
> Hello World
> >>> 
> ```

### Terminal : You just need to type python3 and it will open like this (The exact texts may vary)
> ```
> ADITYAs-MacBook-Air:c aditya$ python3
> Python 3.6.5 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Apr 26 2018, 08:42:37) 
> [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] on darwin
> Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
> >>> 
> ```

## Writing Code
You can use/copy [sample.c](https://github.com/ramanaditya/beginners/blob/master/C/sample.c) file and edit in that and save that with different names
