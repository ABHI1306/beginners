###### INTRODUCTION

MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments. 

###### Why MicroPython ?

 With MicroPython you can write clean and simple Python code to control hardware instead of having to use complex low-level languages like C or C++ (what Arduino uses for programming).

###### What can MicroPython do?

Almost anything you can imagine!  Just like an Arduino board MicroPython can control hardware and connected devices.  You can control GPIO pins to blink lights, read switches, and more.  You can drive PWM outputs for servos, LEDs, etc. or read analog sensors with an analog to digital converter.  Talking to I2C or SPI devices is easy too, and you'll even find network & WiFi support on some boards.  MicroPython even has libraries for controling other hardware like NeoPixels and LED strips, tiny OLED displays, and more.
