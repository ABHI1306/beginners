GCD AND LCM
<hr>

### GCD

In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For example, the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4.

The greatest common divisor is also known as the greatest common factor (gcf), highest common factor (hcf), greatest common measure (gcm), or highest common divisor.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor"> Read More ...</a>

### LCM

In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by LCM(a, b), is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both different from zero. However, some authors define LCM (a,0) as 0 for all a, which is the result of taking the LCM to be the least upper bound in the lattice of divisibility.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple"> Read More . . .</a>
